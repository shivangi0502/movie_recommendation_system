# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python**. It suggests movies similar to a user’s favorite by analyzing metadata such as **genres**, **cast**, **keywords**, and **director**. The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization**, **cosine similarity**, and **fuzzy matching** to generate accurate and personalized movie recommendations.

## 🔍 **Features**

- **Suggests top 10 similar movies** based on content
- **Fuzzy matching** handles typos and partial titles (e.g., "Twilite" ➝ *Twilight*)
- **Scalable and fast** – suitable for real-time use
- Requires **no user history** – purely metadata-based
- Built using **clean modular code** for easy understanding and expansion

## 🧠 **Technologies Used**

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – TF-IDF & cosine similarity
- **Fuzzywuzzy** – fuzzy string matching
